/**
 * AR Placement Utilities
 * 
 * Converts real-world GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude) to local AR coordinates (x, z).
 * Handles bearing calculations for character orientation.
 * 
 * Features to implement:
 * - Convert lat/lng to local meters (x, z) relative to user position
 * - Calculate bearing/heading between two GPS points
 * - Transform GPS coordinates to AR scene coordinate system
 * - Handle coordinate rotation based on device compass heading
 * - Provide helpers for placing objects at specific distances/angles
 * 
 * Example:
 * - User at (lat1, lng1), character spawn at (lat2, lng2)
 * - Calculate: { x: 10, z: -5 } meters for AR placement
 * - Calculate bearing: 45° for character rotation
