# 3D Models Directory

Place your GLB character models here (1-2 MB each recommended).

## Recommended Structure:
```
models/
├── character1.glb
├── character2.glb
├── character3.glb
└── textures/
    ├── character1_texture.png
    └── character2_texture.png
```

## Guidelines:
- Keep GLB files under 2 MB for optimal AR performance
- Use compressed textures (JPEG/PNG, 512x512 or 1024x1024)
- Include animations in GLB (idle, walk, interact)
- Test models in Viro before deploying
